Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
